# KhanThomas

This repo contains my project for [John Stachurski's computational economics course](https://github.com/jstac/quantecon_nyu_2016). The project implements methods for solving heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks. The techniques are demonstrated on the [Khan and Thomas (2008)](http://www.aubhik-khan.net/ecta5894.pdf) model. The methods and all codes are adapted from materials found on [Ben Moll's website](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/PHACTproject.htm).

**Description of files**
* `Gregory_Project.pdf`: contains a description of the model and solution method, and discusses some results
* `KhanThomas.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that describes and runs all the code
* The Code folder contains the `.jl` files. All the code is the same as what's in the Jupyter notebook. The main file is `KhanThomas.jl`
